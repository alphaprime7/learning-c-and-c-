# learning-c-and-c-
A bunch of code when i thought it will be fun learning c++ till my brain blew up. While in school taking full loads, research, doing some R as seen in my spectrophotometry project, i thought wait it will be fun to go insane and learn c++ and this is what i came up with using Atom code editor.
